# Archive Directory

This directory contains experimental, redundant, and legacy files that are not part of the main codebase but are preserved for historical reference.

## Structure

### python/
Experimental and proof-of-concept Python scripts that were created during development but are not part of the production system:
- **Demo scripts**: Various demo and proof-of-concept implementations
- **Production test scripts**: Testing and validation scripts from development phases
- **Debug utilities**: Debug and verification scripts
- **Truth/assessment scripts**: Honest assessment and reality check scripts from early development

### scripts/
Redundant or outdated build and setup scripts that have been superseded by the current build system.

### misc/
Miscellaneous files including:
- Protocol buffer definitions and generated code
- Service configuration files
- Legacy manifests and configuration keys
- Old batch scripts and verification tools

## Why These Files Are Archived

These files represent the evolution of the project and may contain useful patterns or ideas for future reference, but they are:
- Superseded by newer implementations
- Experimental code that was not integrated into production
- Debug/test utilities that are no longer needed
- Redundant implementations of existing functionality

## Using Archived Files

⚠️ **Warning**: Files in this directory may be outdated, incomplete, or incompatible with the current codebase. They should not be used in production without thorough review and testing.

If you need to reference or resurrect any of these files:
1. Review the file thoroughly for security issues
2. Update it to work with the current codebase
3. Test extensively before integrating
4. Consider whether the functionality already exists in the main codebase
